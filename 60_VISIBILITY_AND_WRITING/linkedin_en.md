## About

I am a Data Scientist focused on creating practical and impactful solutions. With a solid foundation in statistics, machine learning, and software engineering, I specialize in the entire project lifecycle: from data ingestion and exploratory analysis to model training, deployment via APIs, and creating interactive dashboards.

My portfolio demonstrates my ability to handle diverse challenges, including market basket analysis, time series forecasting, and financial risk classification. I am always seeking new opportunities to apply my skills to solve complex problems and generate measurable results.

## Experience / Projects (5 Bullets)

*   **Market Basket Analysis:** Developed a recommendation engine using the Apriori algorithm to identify product associations, resulting in a set of rules with a lift greater than 2.0 to optimize cross-selling strategies.
*   **Iris Flower Classifier API:** Built and deployed a FastAPI application to serve a Random Forest model, achieving 96% accuracy. The project includes a Dockerized environment for easy reproduction.
*   **Interactive Dashboard:** Created a Streamlit dashboard to allow real-time classification of Iris flowers, providing a user-friendly interface for a machine learning model.
*   **CI/CD Pipeline:** Implemented a continuous integration workflow with GitHub Actions to automate linting, testing, and environment setup, ensuring code quality and reproducibility.
*   **End-to-End Project Structure:** Designed and implemented a modular and scalable repository structure for data science projects, covering everything from data pipelines to deployment and governance.
