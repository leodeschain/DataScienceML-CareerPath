### Post 1: Sharing a Project

**Title:** From Raw Data to Deployed API: My Latest Project on [Project Topic]! ðŸš€

**Body:**
I'm excited to share my latest project: a complete market basket analysis to uncover hidden purchasing patterns.

I went from a raw transaction dataset to a deployed set of association rules that can power a recommendation system.

Key steps:
1.  Data cleaning and preprocessing.
2.  Applying the Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets.
3.  Generating actionable rules with metrics like confidence and lift.

The result? We can now predict that a customer buying bread is 65% likely to also buy butter!

### Post 2: Technical Deep Dive

**Title:** Why I Chose FastAPI for My Latest ML Project

**Body:**
When it's time to deploy a machine learning model, the choice of framework matters. For my Iris classifier, I chose FastAPI, and here's why:

âœ… **High Performance:** It's one of the fastest Python frameworks available, thanks to Starlette and Pydantic.
âœ… **Easy to Use:** The syntax is intuitive and requires less boilerplate code.
âœ… **Automatic Docs:** Interactive API documentation (Swagger UI) is generated automatically. This is a game-changer for testing and collaboration.

By wrapping my Scikit-learn model with FastAPI, I created a robust, production-ready API in just a few hours.

What's your go-to framework for deploying ML models?
